## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Flexbox is a simple and convenient way of creating a flexible layout without using float or positioning. It comes with many uses like vertically centering a block of elements inside its parent to creating children inside a container to have the same amount of the available width/height.

Here is a snipper of what I have learn and applied into this challenge

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Center_an_element) - This helped me for centering some of the elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how Flexbox works. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
